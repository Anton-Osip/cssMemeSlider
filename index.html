            This cute boy, Charly, is three years old and he likes adults
            and kids. He isnâ€™t fond of many other dogs, so he might do
            best in a single dog home. Charly has lots of energy, and
            loves to run and play. We think a fenced yard would make him
            very happy.

            being able to go outside to run and play, but won't hesitate
            to play up a storm in the house if she has all of her favorite
            toys.
